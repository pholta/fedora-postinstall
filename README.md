# Fedora Postinstall script

This is a Fedora (29+) postinstall Bash script, which I run just after a fresh installation of Fedora to install all my favourite SW and tweak the look of Gnome 

## How to use the script
Open your terminal and run: 

```
wget https://raw.github.com/pholta/fedora-postinstall/master/fedora-postinstall.sh
chmod u+x ./fedora-postinstall.sh 
./fedora-postinstall.sh
```
